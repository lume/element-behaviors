# Specificty of the following rules matters (not the order).

# Ignore everything,
/**/*

# but include these folders
!/dist/**/*
!/src/**/*

# except for these files in the above folders.
/dist/**/*.test.*
/dist/tests/**/*
/src/**/*.test.*
/src/tests/**/*

# The following won't work as you think it would.
# /**/*
# !/dist/**/*
# !/src/**/*
# /**/*.test.* # This is less specific than the previous two rules, so it does nothing.

# Include these project-specific files.
# (none yet)
